All right, but... Is it good? Did you issue it already? I thought you hit it. Look at that, man. You like three cars faster. Man, how am I going to pull over three cars at the same time? Damn! Well, give me my ticket. I wear glasses anyway. That shit ain't going to win. All right, here's your court appearance for driving without your license on you, okay? You know that's a misdemeanor in the state, right? You got to have your license on you. What's up? You know that, right? Yeah, I just left the gym. You know where I am, bro. Come on, man. I understand. I was just going to write you the waveable ticket for the tail light and stuff, but then you didn't have your driver's license on you, so I got to write you for that. For the tail light? Yeah, for the brake light. Not working in the front tint. Those are waveable, okay? So if you get those taken care of within 10 days, you'll be good to go. What are those? What drives? Like, you get it fixed, and then you go talk to any police officer, and they'll sign off on it that it's been fixed, and it's good to go. All right, but this is your appearance on the front here? Yeah. This is your appearance date for the driving without your license on you? Man, that's ridiculous. All right. Yeah. Why'd you pull me over, man? Like, the real reason, bro. Why? Yeah. Because our chief doesn't like front-tinted windows? Fuck the chief. I don't care. I don't care. I don't care about my shit. Fuck you. Fuck you, I just said. Your windows tinted, aren't they? Nope. I don't know. You can give me a fuck about it. Chief. Don't trade the bills. You all set them? You all set? Yeah. You want me off? Yeah. You good? Oh, well, yeah. Back him the shake out of your car, too. What? The weed on the floor. The weed on the fucking floor? Shut up. Okay. Where do you see weed at? Where do you see weed? No. What's that green thing right there? What? What's what? What's in Iraq now? Or that? Could possibly be marijuana. What's that? What's that? All right. All right. All right. Are we searching your car? What is the problem? You're the problem. Nobody's searching. Nobody's searching. Where's your car? Calm down. What is weed being here?
