Okay, you might have to contact them and find out and tell them the situation, but that's an inspection that's completely separate. They might make you go into an inspection to get the registration done. So then, could that be done from the lock? Probably not, but it's probably done in Nevada, I guess. It's probably around their inspection stations. No, you can take this one and check remotely. I've done it before in Illinois, so I'm not sure what... I can only tell you New Jersey. I have no idea about... If I told you something, it might be completely correct. New Jersey, I can tell you 100%. What's the process? I have no idea what it's about. You're going to have to call their DMV. Unfortunately, not for Monday. It's a holiday weekend, so... Alright, so you guys are all set? What's your driver's identity? What do we need? How do we get the car back? Valid registration, valid insurance part. How do they know that this is her car? Like, don't you need to give us a receipt or something? Like, how are they going to know that this is the receipt? This goes on file. Hi, I'm Karen Turner. Hi. I'm a resident. There you go. It's fine. I don't need that. Okay, fine. I'm Karen Turner. You're just here as the rider, right? No, I'm not. I'm here as a concerned citizen and friend of the mayor, and been in 10 apply for 20 years. I take full responsibility for them. And what is the reason they were pulled over? The driver has all the information. He'll tell you. No, no, no, no, no. I need to know. No, you don't need to know. Okay. We're not involved here. You're picking them up? I'm involved. Well, I'm not going to tell you. You need the driver with the automobile. He's over 18. That's all you need to know. Um... Okay, okay. If you can... We don't need to see credentials. Okay, okay. You need a... You need a... If you can give me a little bit of space here. What's the reason? Are you a commissioner? I am a commissioner. One of the commissioners, and I'm heading up... Do you have an ID with that? That is my ID, and that is my business card. I am the commissioner of the court authority, and I'm heading up over 4,000 people. Okay. So, if there's a problem, I think I have... There's no problem. Well, I think there's a problem... And I'm registered vehicle. Okay. Let's hear... Why were they pulled over, first of all? Miss. Now, don't call me miss. I'm commissioner. Thank you. Commissioner? Yes. Why were they pulled over? All due respect. Yeah. Why are they pulled over? The driver with them. No, no, no. I need to know. The car's getting towed now. Why is the car getting towed? Go ask him. No, no. I'm asking. You're the person who ordered it, and trust me... Miss, this is not involved in one percent. Yeah, it does. It does. It does, because I'm picking them up, and I'm offering to take responsibility for them, and you can't even tell me the charge, and I'm also an attorney. So, I think if you can't tell me, what is the problem? That's fine. Why is it so difficult to just say why did it fall over? Why did it start being tough? Because everything has already been explained. I know, but I don't know. Why can't you tell? Because this is impacting me because I got four people who are coming back to my house including people who live in New Haven attending Yale Grasswood School, a PhD student, and I don't know why it's so difficult to say what the problem is. This is impacting me. On Easter Sunday, I got to take four people back to New Haven. I'll be honest with you. Should I be frank with you? Yeah, I want to know what the problem is. It's more of the way you just approached me and your demeanor. You know what? Okay, that's... I'm being honest with you. I want to know why... I just don't appreciate your demeanor. I don't appreciate... You're being very demanding with me. No, I'm asking you a question which is not being answered. But it doesn't need to be answered. It's irrelevant. You know what? If you'd like to read my report, you can come down with these former records on Monday and you can get a copy of it. And you can... I am under... There is no... You have no right to know what's going on. Sorry, but this is... No, I do. Explain to me why. Because these are four people that I have to take responsibility... You're just a concerned... Why do you have to take responsibility? They're all adults. That's my daughter. And she has... She's a backseat passenger. She's a backseat passenger. And there's a problem with you describing it because you don't feel confident... Describing what? Why these people are being called over and... Your daughter has been summoned. She was not the driver. This is not her vehicle. It's not your vehicle. How are you involved? This is not going to be... If you have a problem explaining what the problem is and why their car is being confiscated, then we have a problem. Why would you ask me? I will be in with the commissioner of police, of Ten Apply. It will be. Take a step back. If you can't describe what the problem is... Take a step back for me. I can't move back any farther. I keep moving back farther and you keep moving closer to me. Can you take a step back? Take a step back. I don't want the problem is... Because I'm not because of the weird demeanor. No. I came in very nicely. I am under no legal obligation to tell you. And I'm under no legal obligation to tell you what I will be doing. But if you can do whatever you want to do... We've been... She's been... This is a lawful motor vehicle stop. You are here to pick them up. Okay? It's going to be a report. The driver has been advised of everything that's going on. Okay. I was there for your graduation when you guys came in. In the camp. And it wasn't that long. Congratulations. What are you talking about? Okay. Okay. Well, congratulations. Thank you very much. It's been great. And happy. Have a nice day. Thank you for your information and help. You know what? I hope you have a really nice holiday weekend too. Because you just ruined it for a lot of people. Without even the decency. I didn't ruin anything. I was doing my job. Yeah, you did. I would just hope you being a commissioner. This is their path over. That you would understand the job these officers have to do. But... There is no explanation. How can I understand? You don't have the decency. You didn't even ask him. Well, I'm asking you because you're the one that made me... I'm going to the store. I don't understand the way you approach me, the way you demand information, the way you're stating based off of your prediction in another agency. I'm asking you. Whatever it may be. I mean, you have a business card with credentials. I don't know you. I just met you a minute ago. You have no official identification. So, Louis, you know, Louis, what's your name? Schmaradopsky? What does that have to do with anything? Well, I'm just telling you who I am. I've been in the town for a long time. As a courtesy, I would like to understand the rationale for their being pulled over and their card confiscated. This is a courtesy. I don't know why it's difficult. You know what? I believe you could ask your daughter and the driver of the motor vehicle. My daughter is a faxed passenger. Exactly. You were making the accusation. I would like to know. What accusation? The accusation of, I don't know what you just told me, you told me to go Monday and read the report. When these kids, you said ask them. It's not them. I'm not going to ask the driver what you are using them or what you're doing. I'm asking you because you're the source of the accusation. They are not the source, you're the source. So I'm trying to go to the source if you want me to go to their side of the story as well. I think that's the best thing I did at this point. I'm very disappointed in the way the two of you are acting. You cannot even tell me. A mother living in Kennafly for 20 years with two kids who went through the school system, what's the problem? And that's shocking. It's shocking that you can't even give me a sense of no. I think you should conclude this for safety reasons. This is a high-speed road. I think we should all get off of the road. I'm so sorry. Thank you for your concern with my safety. I don't need it. You can't put a sentence together. Sorry. That's the setting and you are a disappointment and you are just following him. So you are also a disappointment. You can't put together a sentence of what the problem is. Are you finished, ma'am? I'm shocked and very disappointed. Thank you for your help. You may take them now. You may not tell me when to take my child. You may shut the fuck up and not tell me when I may take my kids and her friends who are PhD students from MIT and Yale. You may tell me nothing because you told me nothing. Shame on both of you. I will be talking to the chief of police and I will be speaking to the mayor. Badge number 540. I got your name. I got your name. Just to make sure there's no discrepancy. There's no discrepancy. Matt is the person. No. Don't you worry. As long as you got all the information right. You can put a sentence together. That's shameful. That's shameful. Have a pleasant weekend. You have a wonderful weekend. You're the best. No question. I can't even tell you the reason. I need to read the line. Are you tomorrow? What company are you? Find out the what? The location of the event. No, it's at the police department. Okay. Police headquarters. Look at this. Shame on you. Shame on you. Have a pleasant day. Have a nice day. Take care now. Have a nice weekend. Ma'am, where are you going exactly? What's your address? Get away from me. I'm asking. No, no. I came to see his address. I came to get his address. This is a police contract. Ma'am, you've made five people my partner. I hope you're happy. Go right now. You're my job. And you, no. No, you're not. I don't want you to get in the kitchen. I love that. How about... I'm not in here talking to you. I agree, I agree. You are not a nice person. And five people are crying. You're brewing their Easter, you're brewing your Passover. Someone, an investment bank, they're in there from London. You're brewing it, they were just going for a hike, and you can't even... I hope you're very happy, because you seem to have a smug ass look on your face, and you seem to teach me. I don't know why it's so hard to say what the reason is, or where the problem is. Why? You work with police officers, right? Yeah, I work with 4,000 of them. I'm just a little bit disappointed that. You don't get to be disappointed in me. You don't seem like a very... very big police supporter. I don't know. You said you would have more of an insight, a look at the job. It's caught me by surprise, based off your demeanor a little bit. Yeah, okay. Using inappropriate words and stuff. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You know what, Matt? This isn't going to go down nicely. You're not a nice person. And it's really hard for me to understand why you can't say, the problem is, they don't have this, or they do have that. Two sentences. That's not, I ask you. The driver couldn't have been any nicer. I ask you, they're all crying in there. The driver couldn't have been nicer? I don't care about the driver being nicer, not a nice. I ask you, and you can't even put a sentence together. That's a problem. This is the way you approach me and your demeanor. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm sorry. Matt, you've got a chance to put it together now, but you can't put the sentence together now. What does this say? You're disappointed. Well, go to resting. You can go to whoever you'd like to go to. It's irrelevant to me. I'm doing my job. I've done nothing inappropriate. And if I go and say what's the address and what do we have to do, that's inappropriate too. You need to tell me for that too? I don't know why you're coming over to a vehicle that's likely being impounded. Because I want to know where it's going. I know what you're doing. The driver was advised where it's going. As was your daughter. I'm not. Your daughter was very nice as well. She asked and I told her. Guess what? I'm not so nice. And you can tell that to everybody. And it's fine. And I've been, and the police have all been in my home and in my second home and in the third home in Santa Clara. I don't know how that's relevant, but this is crazy. It's very smart. I know. Very smart. Maybe you need a few more tests to go through. Okay. Okay. Okay. I appreciate your patience, thank you. Thank you.
